# Project Title

Weather Forecasting and Analysis using KNN Algorithm


## Overview

This project is a weather forecasting and analysis tool built using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The tool predicts weather conditions based on historical data and provides various analytical insights.


## Authors

## Features

1. Predict weather conditions using the KNN algorithm.
2. Analyze historical weather data.
3. Visualize weather patterns and trends.
4. User-friendly interface for inputting data and viewing results.
